# blood-donation-management-system
My first Project after learning Java basics.

Console-based system to manage blood donors and help locate compatible donors during emergencies.

Features of this program:
1.Add new Blood Donors
2.Show all Donors
3.Search any Donor by their BloodGroup
4.Remove any blood donor using their name.
5.Avoids duplicate donor entries using name
6.Store and load donors data from a file

Technologies/Concepts Used:
Java
OOPS concept
ArrayLists
File Handling using java
Git and Github

Steps to Run the file:
1.Clone the repository
2.compile all ".java" files
3.Run main.java
4.Navigate to desired outcome using the interactive menu

What I learnt from this project:
Java OOPs basics
How to handle file hading for storing data
The Arraylist data structure to store the donors data
A menu driven program,easy to navigate
